# [CHAT-2.3] SQL queries

## Input

SQL query for BigQuery that pulls from my ecommerce.products table and returns id, cost, name, brand, retail_price, and sku. The query should be filtered to show only "Men" department and "Swim" category.

## Output (Quen 3 4B)

```
sql

SELECT id, cost, name, brand, retail_price, sku 
FROM `ecommerce.products` 
WHERE department = 'Men' AND category = 'Swim';
```

**Explanation:**  
This query selects specific columns from the `products` table, filtering rows where the `department` is "Men" and the `category` is "Swim". The backticks around `ecommerce.products` ensure proper handling of table names in BigQuery.

To write a SQL query for BigQuery that pulls the specified fields (`id`, `cost`, `name`, `brand`, `retail_price`, and `sku`) from the `ecommerce.products` table and filters for products in the "Men" department and "Swim" category, you can use the following query:

```
sql

SELECT 
  id, 
  cost, 
  name, 
  brand, 
  retail_price, 
  sku
FROM 
  `your_project_id.your_dataset_id.ecommerce.products`
WHERE 
  department = 'Men'
  AND category = 'Swim';
```

### Explanation:
- `id`, `cost`, `name`, `brand`, `retail_price`, and `sku` are the columns you're selecting.
- The `FROM` clause specifies the `ecommerce.products` table. Replace `your_project_id` and `your_dataset_id` with your actual project and dataset IDs in BigQuery.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include products where the `department` is "Men" and the `category` is "Swim".

### Notes:
- Make sure the column names (`department`, `category`, etc.) match the actual column names in your `ecommerce.products` table. Adjust them if necessary.
- If your department or category names are case-sensitive or have different formats (like "men" vs "Men"), make sure to account for that in the query.

## Input

I need a SQL query for MySQL. My schema name is ecommerce and the tables are users and orders. I want an output that gives me each user's name (users.name) and email, with the total number of orders each user has made, and the total number of items they have purchased (orders.num_of_item). The orders table has a user_id column. I also need to filter to only show orders with status of "Complete" and created_at later than Jan 1, 2020. Order the results by the total number of orders from highest at the top to lowest at the bottom.

## Output (Quen 3 4B)

Here's a SQL query for MySQL that meets your requirements:

```
sql

SELECT 
    u.name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(o.user_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(o.num_of_item) AS total_items
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE o.status = 'Complete'
  AND o.created_at > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name, u.email
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Tables Used:**
   - `users`: Contains user information (`name`, `email`, `user_id`).
   - `orders`: Contains order details (`user_id`, `status`, `created_at`, `num_of_item`).

2. **Key Components:**

   - **JOIN:** `INNER JOIN` connects the `users` and `orders` tables on `user_id`.

   - **Filtering:** The `WHERE` clause ensures only orders with status `"Complete"` and created after January 1, 2020 are considered.

   - **Aggregation:**

     - `COUNT(o.user_id)` gives the total number of orders per user.

     - `SUM(o.num_of_item)` adds up all items purchased by each user.

   - **Grouping:** Results are grouped by user to aggregate order and item counts.

   - **Sorting:** The final result is sorted by `total_orders` in descending order.

---

### Assumptions:

- The `orders.num_of_item` column exists and holds the number of items per order.

- The `users.user_id` is a unique identifier for users.

- The date filter is correct (`created_at > '2020-01-01'`).

- All required fields are present in both tables.
