# [CHAT-2.1] Math word problem

## Input

Ten friends have a dinner in a restaurant. Since four of them don't carry any money, the other six friends pay for them. How much cheaper for each of these six friends would it be if everybody had paid?

## Output (Gemini 2.5 Flash)

For each of the six friends who paid, the cost would have been **one-fifteenth** ($1/15$) cheaper if all ten friends had contributed equally.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Cost per person (6 friends paying):** Each of the six friends paid a share of the total bill, let's call it $C$. So, each paid $C/6$.

* **Cost per person (10 friends paying):** If everyone had paid, each of the ten friends would have contributed an equal share of the bill, or $C/10$.

* **The difference:** To find out how much cheaper it would have been, you subtract the hypothetical cost from the actual cost:
    $$(C/6) - (C/10) = (5C/30) - (3C/30) = 2C/30 = C/15$$

For example, if the total dinner bill was $150:

* The six friends who paid each spent $150/6 = $25.

* If everyone had paid, each person's share would have been $150/10 = $15.

* The difference is $25 - $15 = $10, which is equal to $150/15$.

## Input

Ten friends have a dinner in a restaurant. Since four of them don't carry any money, the other six friends pay for them. How much cheaper for each of these six friends would it be if everybody had paid?

(A) 60% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) 30% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) 45% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) 40% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (E) 50%

## Output (Gemini 2.5 Flash)

The correct answer is **(D) 40%**.

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

#### 1. Define the variables

Let's assume the total dinner bill is $C$.

#### 2. Calculate the costs

* The cost for each of the six friends who paid is the total bill divided by the number of people who paid:
    $$\text{Cost per friend (actual)} = \frac{C}{6}$$

* The cost for each friend if everyone had paid would be the total bill divided by the total number of friends:
    $$\text{Cost per friend (hypothetical)} = \frac{C}{10}$$

#### 3. Calculate the difference in cost

The amount each of the six friends would have saved is the difference between the actual cost and the hypothetical cost:
$$\text{Savings} = \frac{C}{6} - \frac{C}{10} = \frac{5C - 3C}{30} = \frac{2C}{30} = \frac{C}{15}$$

#### 4. Convert the savings to a percentage

To find the percentage by which the cost was cheaper, we divide the amount saved by the actual cost that the six friends paid, and then multiply by 100.
$$\text{Percentage Savings} = \frac{\text{Savings}}{\text{Actual Cost}} \times 100\%$$
$$\text{Percentage Savings} = \frac{\frac{C}{15}}{\frac{C}{6}} \times 100\% = \frac{C}{15} \times \frac{6}{C} \times 100\%$$
$$= \frac{6}{15} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{5} \times 100\% = 0.4 \times 100\% = 40\%$$
