---

## What is prompt engineering?

- **Prompt engineering** involves crafting prompts that effectively communicate the task at hand to an LLM, leading to accurate and useful outputs.

- It requires understanding the nuances of language, the specific domain being worked on, and the capabilities and limitations of the LLM being used.

- Though the basic ideas are still valid, some of the early examples of prompt engineering may be no longer useful, due to the continuous improvement of the models developed by the AI industry.
