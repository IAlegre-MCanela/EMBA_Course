# [CHAT-5.1] Age riddle

## Input

Ten years ago, my age was four times the age of my brother. Right now, it is the double. How old am I?

(A) 20 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) 40 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) 25 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) 35 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (E) None of the others

## Output (gemma-3-12b-it)

Here's how to solve this word problem:

**Let:**

*   Your current age be "y"
*   Your brother's current age be "b"

**Translate the information into equations:**

*   Ten years ago, your age was y - 10 and your brother's age was b - 10.  The problem states: y - 10 = 4(b - 10)
*   Currently, your age is double your brother's age: y = 2b

**Solve the system of equations:**

1.  **Substitute** the second equation (y = 2b) into the first equation:
    2b - 10 = 4(b - 10)

2.  **Simplify and solve for b:**
    2b - 10 = 4b - 40
    30 = 2b
    b = 15

3.  **Substitute** the value of b (15) back into the equation y = 2b:
    y = 2 * 15
    y = 30

Therefore, you are currently **30 years old**. Since this isn't one of the options, the answer is (E) None of the others.
